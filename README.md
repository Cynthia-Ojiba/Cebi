The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on the given variables.
In this project, my teammate, Ebi and I, explored the data set to draw meaningful insights from the data as you will see in the notebook.
We also tested several regression models to discover which of them had the greatest accuracy in predicting the cost of health insurance when other variables have been provided.
We carried out hyper parameter tuning using randomized search, and evaluated the model thereafter.
